# OpenCRP Project

Many of the work processes and tasks demand great precision, error-free operations and high quality outcomes. Humans are not at their best
in these actions. Due to this human frailty, many duties can be assigned to be carried out by automatized platforms. Healthcare and hospice
operations retain processes, which can be assisted by mobile robots. The service architecture model developed in Tampere University of
Technology, Pori, consists of a novel mobile cloud robotic platform in the supporting of patient work. The developed ecosystem, OpenCRP,
holds an open-source cloud computing platform, software frameworks and a physical multi-robot environment for the automation or assisting of
preprogrammed work processes.

Mobile robots with service-oriented functions are stepping to our lives in hospitals, hospices and industries where robots can help to assist or
perform all the arduous working duties. A lot of laborious processes can be identified that can be automatized, e.g. in hospital medicine delivery and
food servery to ward for patients. The service architecture model presents a pilot- and demonstration environment for multiple open-source mobile
robots sharing their collected data with each other via a private cloud. In addition, the presented platform introduces a novel ecosystem based on an
open-source software frameworks and robots.
